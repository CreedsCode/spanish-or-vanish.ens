## This is my blog!
This is my new little baby, this projects hosts my portfolio/blog as a dapp! Fully decentralized utilizing new exciting technologies!

My first idea is to build something with a small bundle size, so building plog pages, and then bundling them as a static page into the blog would be my version.

In future I look forward to make this more dynamic and build an CMS around it.

## Current design:
I will be using [fleek](https://fleek.co/) to manage the hosting of this art piece. It's purpose is to deploy on IPFS and integrate with ENS seamlessly. Check them out!

The page is build with astro! I try to minimize the file size so this is the next best options.
